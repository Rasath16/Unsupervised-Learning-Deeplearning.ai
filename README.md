# Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning ‚Äì Machine Learning Specialization

This repository contains my **course notes, Jupyter notebooks, and diagrams** from the **Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, and Reinforcement Learning** course in the *Machine Learning Specialization* by [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/) and [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/).

This course explores **unsupervised machine learning**, **recommendation systems**, and **reinforcement learning**, providing the tools to make machines learn without explicit labels.
